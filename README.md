# Manalang_Enrico_ITBA4101

Simple Node/Express project serving a static student profile page for Enrico Manalang.

## What I changed
- Added a new static design under `public/` (`index.html` + `styles.css`) with an improved layout, avatar, and responsive styling.
- Updated `Server.js` to serve the static page and assets.
- Added a `start` script in `package.json` for convenience.

## Run it locally
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Feel free to edit `public/index.html` and `public/styles.css` to tweak the design.
